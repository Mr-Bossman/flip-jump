0.  FlipJump Description

    FlipJump (*.fj files) is an instruction architecture with only 1 instruction (OISC).

    It is defined over a w-bits bit-wide memory (fully shared between instructions and memory),
    and starts executing from address 0 (maintains an IP - Instruction Pointer).

    Overall The instruction Flips a bit, then Jumps:
    FlipJump F J
      will flip (invert, making 0->1 and 1->0) the F'th bit in memory,
      and jump to address J.

    Specifically, Each cycle the CPU (execute 1 FlipJump operation, which is):
        0. Reads w bits from IP   onwards, and interprets them as an unsigned little-endian number F
        1. Flips (inverts) the F'th bit in memory
        2. Reads w bits from IP+w onwards, and interprets them as an unsigned little-endian number J
        3. Jumps to (IP = ) the J'th bit in memory

    and in pseudo code:
    def fj_cpu_64(w, mem):
        uint64 IP = 0
        while True:
            mem[read_64(mem, IP)] = !mem[read_64(mem, IP)]
            IP = mem[read_64(mem, IP+w)]

    The instructions and memory aren't separated, and FJ operation may, and sometimes should, modify existing instructions.
    An instruction can even modify itself, while it is running! Look at the next instruction (8bit machine, address 0):
     >00: 0b
      08: 10
    At first it seems like after flipping the bit, the IP is set to 10, but it's wrong!
    The flipped bit is in the second word (its 3'rd bit) and therefore after flipping, the memory data is:
      00: 0b
     >08: 18
      And the IP will set to 18.

    Can you code something meaningful in fj?



1.  FlipJump compiled file & assembly

    There are three kinds of fj files:
    .fjm - Flip-Jump Memory     - binary file containing the code in segments
    .fj  - FlipJump assembly    - text file containing fj assembly with macros, and/or macros declarations.

    ----------

    The .fjm file format (uX is an unsigned X-bit little endian number):

    struct {
        u16 fj_magic;   // 'F' + 'J'<<8  (0x4a46)
        u16 word_size;  // in bits
        u64 flags;
        u64 segment_num;
        struct segment {
            u64 segment_start;  // in memory words (w-bits)
            u64 segment_length; // in memory words (w-bits)
            u64 data_start;     // in the outer-struct.data words (w-bits)
            u64 data_length;    // in the outer-struct.data words (w-bits)
        } *segments;             // segments[segment_num]
        u8* data;               // the data
    } fjm_file;     // Flip-Jump Memory file

    ----------

    FJ assembly file is of the kind:
      comment before : F;J // comment after
    Everything after the first // or before the last : is ignored.
    The only restriction on comments - no '//' can be before the ':'.

    F;J means flip the F'th bit, then jump to address J.
    They are both written in hexadecimal, and they can both be one of the next forms:
      100         (equals 100)
      100[3]      (equals 103)
      100[3*10]   (equals 130)
      67[20][2]   (equals 89)
      label         (equals label)
      label[3]      (equals label+3)
      label[20][2]  (equals label+22)

    The number in the [brackets] is just added to the first one (can be negative, or a product of two numbers)

    The next forms are also acceptable (instead of using F;J):
      F     (<==> F;)
      ;J
      ;
    If F is missing - it will be replaced with the label temp (defined in the standard library).
    If J is missing - it will be replaced with the next memory-word address (as in no jumping at all).

    Labels are of the form (label_name) and can appear before and after each opcode:
    For example:
      (label) 40;20
      40;20 (label)
      ; (label)
      (label) ;
      ...
    Or on a line of its own:
      (label)
        40;40
    Labels can be adjacent to each other:
      (l0)(l1)  (l2)  40;20   (l3)  (l4)(l5)(l6) (l7)
    The label references the start of the next memory bit,
      e.g. (label)40;50 references the address of 40, while 40;50(label) references the address after the 50.

    ----------

    FJ Macros are defined using .def and .end:
      .def name parameter_1 parameter_2 ... parameter_n
        // macro body
      .end

    You can use a macro by the . operator:
    .macro_name arg_1 arg_2 ... arg_n
    This line will be replaced with the macro's body when compiled to .fj file.

    Macro Example:
        .def flip4 x
            x[0];
            x[1];
            x[2];
            x[3];
        .end

    You can define a repeated sequence using .rep and .end:
      .rep n i
        // repeated body
      .end
    You can also use the shortcut  .rep n i macro_name [macro_args..], for repeating a macro.

    The same example as the above, but using rep:
        .def flip4 x
            .rep 4 i
                x[i];
            .end
        .end

    You can also pass use it like this:
        .def flip n x
            .rep n i
                x[i];
            .end
        .end
    For a more general macro :)

    If there was a macro
      .def flip1 x
        x;
      .end,
    it could've been shortened even more!
        .def flip n x
            .rep n i flip1 x[i]
        .end



2.  Input/Output

    IO is done in bits (every ascii char is inputted/outputted by its bits, lsb to msb ordered).
    In order to handle io - cells no. 2,3 (starting at bits 2*w, or IO) are special:

    - Flipping IO[0] (or IO[1]) outputs the bit 0 (or 1).

    - When reading the content of IO[dbit] (for flipping or jumping purposes) -
      that bit is filled with an input bit.

    Therefore output is by flipping IO[0] / IO[1],
    and input is by jumping to IO (which by its value will jump to io_handler or io_handler+2w for handling a bit-input of 0 or 1).

    Legal but wrong (these are permitted, but will probably ruin the input functionality):
        - Flipping any value in the 2w-2 bits following IO[0],IO[1].
        - Jumping to any of the 2w-1 bits following IO.

    starting values (for a 64bit computer):
      (IO)
        80: temp
        c0: io_handler



3.  More conventions:

    macro assembly extensions:

        $   => will be replaced with a label never used before (starting with __label, e.g. __label0, __label1, ...).

        ..  => macros that stays until labels-resolve (usually depends on addresses)
            ..pad X (placing zero-bits until address divides X*dw)
            ..flip_by to_address by_address (for every 1 in by_address's address - flip the corresponding bit in to_address)
            ..flip_by_dbit to_address by_address (same as flip_by, but ignores the bits representing dbit, and the one after)
            ..var n v (N bit variable initialized with the value of v)
            ..output X (1/2 hexadecimal chars, to be outputted (as 8 bits). best for printing ascii char. if more given - will print X&ff)

        n#b => will be replaced by the n-bit word b (given in hex).
               will advance the current address in exactly n bits.


    lib64.fj:

        lib8.fj  lib16.fj  lib32.fj  lib64.fj  are standard libraries,
         created by me to code with fj much simpler.
        They do most of the [code overriding itself] nonsense for you.

        It supplies you with the
         *  .startup (to use on the start) and .startup in0 in1
         *  number variables (the already initialized zero and one)
         *  the 2dw sized temp label

        cat program for example:

            .startup in0 in1
            ;IO
            (in0)
              IO[0];IO
            (in1)
              IO[1];IO

    bitlib.fj

        The standard library for operations on single-bit-variables.
        It is independent of bit-size (gets the needed constants from the libXX.fj).

        It offers Arithmetic/Logic operations:
          .add x y carry    // x += y
          .or  x y          // x |= y
          .inc x            // x++
        Memory operations:
          .mov dst src      // dst = src
        Conditional operations:
          .test x l0 l1     // goto (x==0 ? l0 : l1)

    veclib.fj

        The standard library for operations on vector of bit-variables.
        It is independent of bit-size (gets the needed constants from the libXX.fj), and have to be included with bitlib.fj.

        It does what bitlib.fj does - but for more bits at a time (specifically, for 2,4,8,16,32,64 bits).
        For example:
          .add 64 x y    // x += y
          .or  64 x y    // x |= y
          .inc 64 x      // x++

    * Note that when using the libXX.fj file, it has to be parsed first.



4.  Memory and variables

    I use big-bits as variables, i.e. I use dw memory-bits to store a bit.
    The cells values are:
      ;0    if the bit is 0
      ;dw   if the bit it 1

    The magic of this representation is if the following:
      If we jump onto the variable, the next operation we will do is either 0 or dw (according to the bit's value).
      The libXX.fj standard library



5.  What can be done?

    Well, that's what I'm interested in!
